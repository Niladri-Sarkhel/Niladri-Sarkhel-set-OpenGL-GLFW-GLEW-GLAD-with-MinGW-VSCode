# set-OpenGL-(GLFW-GLEW-GLAD)-with-MinGW(C/C++)-VSCode

# this repo shows 
1.  how to build these OpenGL libraries for MinGW using CMake

-   GLFW
-   GLEW
-   GLAD

2.  how to **statically** link those libraries with **MinGW C/C++** compiler using **mingw32-make** with the help of a simple **Makefile**

3.  set up with VSCode using **code-runner**

## that's it !! 


>if you don't want to build anything then just grab the **glew.h , glfw3.h, glad.h, glad.c, libglew32.a, libglfw3.a** from this repo and go to linking step . however it is recommended to build the libraries by yourself 


# BUILD LIBRARIES

##  0.  update the graphics drivers of your computer

##  1.  install **CMake** and **MinGW(C/C++)** and add to your **environment variable**

##  2.  build GLFW

go [here](https://www.glfw.org/download.html) then download the **Source package** .
